# Machine Learning / Conversationnal AI Enginner - Technical Tasks
![](https://www.digitalgenius.com/wp-content/themes/digitalgenius/library/img/dg_logo_standard_deepblue.svg)
## Description
In this project I am asked to build machine learnings models for classifying text and to deploy them in a REST API (using Flask).
A full description of the project is available here: https://github.com/eliaswalyba/digital-genius/blob/master/Machine%20Learning%20Engineer%20_%20Conversational%20AI%20Engineer%20-%20Technical.pdf

## What did I built ?
I actually proposed 6 models for this project:
1. Simple Statistical Learning Models
  a. Multinomial Naive Bayes Classifier
  b. Logistic Regression
  c. Linear Support Vector Machines
2. Pretrained Models
  a. Word2Vec
  b. Doc2Vec
3. A simple Neural Network Using Keras
